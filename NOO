Navigate to the Flow Collector tab, and click Create FlowCollector. Make the following selections in the form view:

spec.agent.ebpf.Sampling: Specify a sampling size for flows. Lower sampling sizes will have higher impact on resource utilization. For more information, see the "FlowCollector API reference", spec.agent.ebpf.

If you are using Loki, set the following specifications:

spec.loki.enable: Select the check box to enable storing flows in Loki.

spec.loki.authToken: Select the FORWARD value.

spec.loki.statusUrl: Set this to https://loki-query-frontend-http.netobserv.svc:3100/. The first part of the URL, "loki", must match the name of your LokiStack.
